# UF-RClub2025
Sample files from University of Florida R Club Discussion in 2025

## Files included

+ Example1-tabset.rmd: RMarkdown file showing the use of tabsets to show/hide information
+ Example2-tabset.qmd: Quarto file that is nearly identical to Example 1. Note that tabsets are slightly different in Quarto
+ PopPK Model Diagnostics.qmd: Quarto file that shows how to incorporate R code to build a document that shows the diagnostics for a population PK model
+ ppk: folder with model input and output files from the population pk model. This model was fit with NONMEM.

## Example 1
The first example shows how to organize and format information in an RMarkdown file. In particular it shows how to use CSS coding to change the color of the tabs that separate data/information. Using tabs helps you add a large amount of data/results on a single screen and prevents "scrolling fatigue".

## Example 2
This example is identical to Example 1, but uses the Quarto file format. Quarto is the replacement for RMarkdown. It was released a few years ago and is under active development. In the next 2-3 years it will become the standard rather than RMarkdown. Some of the layout and formatting is different from RMarkdown, but once you learn the new coding approach, it is easy to generate beautiful documents.

## Population PK Diagnostics
This is a short example of how you can create an HTML file to communicate your scientific results. This includes diagnostic plots, tabular summary of the model, and individual model fit plots.
